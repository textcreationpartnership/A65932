            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhame of hypocrites who were ſometimes in company with the Saints, but not caring for them, but ſecretly deſpiſing them in their hearts, are now to be for ever removed from them, and this muſt needs fill their faces with ſhame, and cover them with confuſion as with a mantle before the whole World. 3. For the comfort of the Saints, that they that have been troubled that they have been among the wicked to hear and ſee their wickedneſs as <hi>Lot</hi> was, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7, 8. and glad of the fellowſhip of Godly Pious ones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. may now be for ever ſeparated from all the wicked, and have the fellowſhip of the Elect for ever: this muſt needs rejoice their hearts. 4. For the

                  </gap>eetly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed together upon Earth, and others of them never knew nor ſaw each other: when they all meet together, Oh the ſweet acquaintance they will take of one another, the Bleſſed welcome they will give one to another, it will be a comfortable meeting when they all thus meet together. 5. For the Augmentation of the miſery of the Reprobate who when they all come together ſhall be torture and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment one to another, eſpecially they that have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in wickedneſs together when the whole Maſs and pack of them come together and have none but ſuch as themſelves are, Oh what a wofull condition wil they then be in, its unſpeakable what their miſery will be, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable what the torment of their Soules will be, when they all come together at the time that this ſeparation ſhall be made between the Elect and them 6. For the glory of the Lords mercy and Juſtice in the diſcovery of thoſe who are Elect and of thoſe that are reprobate, for as his mercy is Glorified on the Elect veſſels of mercy, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.6. ſo his Juſtice is Glorified on the veſſels of wrath, <hi>Pro</hi> 16.4. and both will be manifeſt in the day of this ſeparation. 7. For the manifeſtation of them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. for he had need know thoſe that are his, that makes ſuch a ſeparation. 8. For the incouragement of the Lords people now in a way of well-doing, for though at preſent there ſeem to be little difference in ſome reſpects between them and others, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.2. yet then there will be a difference made.</p>

We ſee that ſeparation from true Churches, where the Ordinances are, though ſome not ſo purely diſpenſed, where many Saints are, and where the Lord is bleſſing, aſſiſting, and breathing in thoſe Ordinances and Saints, is certainly not of God, if we can with freedome injoy them: for, if God be there, <hi>Shall mortal man he more juſt then God? ſhall a man be more pure then his Maker?</hi> Job 4.17.

Sheep have nothing in them but is of uſe, their very dung is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. So all of the Saints is of uſe, even that that is the worſt of them, their afflictions, their Sinnes. 8. Sheep when they are killed they are wholy for their Maſters uſe, ſo the Saints when killed are wholy for their Maſters uſe and ſervice, then they are wholy for him: though their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies be unſerviceable, yet in their ſoules they are moſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.23. 9.

We ſee what great difference the Lord puts between men and men, as much as is between Sheep and Goats. 8. We ſee that among evil men, they are the worſt that are leaders in a way of wickedneſs: The leader cauſeth all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulineſs that is in the reſt of the Goats. 9. We ſee what a ſad judgement it is to do much miſchief in a little time againſt our ſelves or others; it is a ſign of a Reprobate and a Goat. 10. We ſee that Reprobates may be known by others, it is eaſie to know a Goat; a man of ſuch a ſpirit, ſo continuing, we may ſay is a Reprobate. 11. We ſee that the more miſchievous any be in the places where they live, the more they diſcover themſelves to be reprobate Goats; for Goats are miſchievous creatures. 12. We ſee that it is a dreadful ſign of Reprobation, to be of an haughty and aſpiring nature, to climb high, and to ſeek great things in the world, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.12. and may be a curb to all proud ſpirits, that would fain be counted above the reſt of their brethren: that ſpirit will undo any man, whoever he is.</p>

We ſee what tenderneſs we ſhould uſe toward his Saints and people, we ſhould do what we can to take them off from all their feares, ſuch as are in temptation that are full of feares, if we judg them ſuch as Chriſt hath acquitted and will acquit at that day, we ſhould do as he doth, do what we can to take them off from all their feares, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Iſai</hi> 35.3, 4. 9.

We ſee what great honour the Lord will put upon his Elect Saints at that day in that he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95629:24"/>will acquit them and abſolve them before his Father and the Holy Angels and the whole World, it is an honour to a poor man that is brought before an earthly Judg to be acquitted before all the company that are preſent at the aſſize. Oh what an honour then will y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord Jeſus put upon them that are his Elect at that day whom he will acquit before God, Angels, and Men, when the whole World ſhall be convented before him: <hi>Such honour have all his Saints,</hi> if the Pſalmiſt ſaid ſo upon a leſs occaſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.9. much more may we ſay ſo upon this. 11. We ſee what a mercy it is to be acquitted here, in the aſſurance of the pardon of our Sins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2. for it is a bleſſed pledg of our acquitting at that day. 12. We ſee how cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially the Lord Jeſus will abſolve his Elect ones at that day, for he it is that hath ſatisfied divine Juſtice, and payd all their debts for them, and therefore will heartily acquit them, and with much cheerfulneſs pronounce the ſentence of abſolution upon them.</p>

               <q>That what the Saints have done well while they were on earth, ſhall be ſpoken of, and mentioned in the day of Judgement.</q>

In that every man that hath done any good, though others have not known of it, ſhall have due praiſe and commendation for it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. 4. In that there ſhall be different degrees of Glory, according to the different meaſures of good that men have done; and therefore all muſt be mentioned and ſpoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Rev</hi> 22.12. 5. In that good has been called evil in the world, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.20, and therefore all that good that has been ſo traduced, and evil ſpoken of, ſhall be owned and ſpoken of at that day. 6. In that the Saints here do vilifie, and diſeſteem their beſt works, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6. <hi>Phil</hi> 3.8, 9. and though indeed in themſelves they be nothing worth, as coming from us, yet as they are in Chriſt, ſo they are good, and will be ſpoken of as ſuch at that day. 7. In that it is not ſo eaſily diſcerned whoſe works are good, in regard that Hypocrites may go very far this way, but that day will declare which is which, which are good and which not. 8. In that for every right work a man is envied of his neighbour here, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.4. 9.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Lord Jeſus.</hi> 1. He commends them here, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2, 3, 8, 9. and therefore will do it much more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. 2.

Oh how well will he then take it, when it is actually performed, and ſpeak of them at that day! 4. He loves them dearly, and where we love, we uſe to ſpeak much in commendation of what is done, much more will Chriſt at that day, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.</p>

They have aimed at the glory of his Name in what they have done, and no wonder then if he ſpeak of what was done, at that day, <hi>John</hi> 15.8. 4.

In that his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned Saints pray for them and their houſes, 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. which is a pledge that he takes it kindly from them. 2. In that they have their lives given them as a prey for this thing, <hi>Jer:</hi> 38.7, 8, 9. with 39.16, 17, 18. 3. In that he reſtores ſuch from ſickneſs to health, <hi>Phil:</hi> 2.25, 27. which is a pledge of the Lords kinde acceptance of it. 4. In that he would have ſuch received with all gladneſs, <hi>Phil:</hi> 2.29. 5. In that he would have ſuch held in reputation, <hi>ibid.</hi> 6. In that he imparts ſome Spiritual bleſſing to them by the Priſoners means, by their ſavoury and gracious communication, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31, 32. 7. In that he bleſſeth them with off ſpring of their bodies, which had none before; as the Keepers wife with whom Dr. <hi>Sands</hi> was Priſoner, being kinde to him, had a Son the next year, according as he told her. 8. In that he takes ſuch with their families into his Covenant, as we ſee in the Jaylor that was kinde to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, Acts</hi> 16 33, 34. 9. In that he fills them with joy in believing, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.34. 10. In that he record<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Sins of Omiſſion are ſuch as Chriſt reproves men for here, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23, 23. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.42. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will ſurely charge them upon them at that day. 4. Sins of Omiſſion are ſuch as mens hearts will condemn
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95629:69"/>them for, as well as ſins of Commiſſion, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.20. 5. Sins of Omiſſion come croſs to the love of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.17. and what wonder then is it if the Lord Jeſus charge them with thoſe ſins at that day? 6. Sins of Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do directly ſtrike at Chriſt, as we ſee in the Text, and will not be charge home ſuch ſins at that day, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.36 7. Sins of Omiſſion hurt others oftentimes as well as a mans ſelfe. A man may commit a ſin ſometimes and hurt no man but himſelfe by it: but by a ſin of Omiſſion he may hort many others; as for example, there may be many that depend upon a man for his Almes, and Charity, which if he omit, he robs them of their due, <hi>Prov</hi> 3.27.

Sins of Omiſſion deſerve death, as well as ſins of Commiſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. and therefore they ſhall be charged with them at that day. 9.

Sins of Omiſſion bring a man into bondage to Satan as well as ſins of Commiſſion, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will be charged at that day. 11. Sins of Omiſſion argue a daring ſpirit againſt God, and tempt God as well as ſins of Commiſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.19, 22, 41, 42, 56. 12. Sins of Omiſſion cauſe the Name of God to be blaſphemed, as well as ſins of Commiſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.21-24. 13. Sins of Omiſſion defile the Conſcience as well as ſins of Commiſſion, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15, 16. 14.

               <p>I ſhall handle the ſeveral Branches aſunder, as I did before: and firſt begin with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmercifulneſs to hungry and thirſty ones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſons</hi> why this ſhall be ſo deeply charged upon them at that day. 1. From the Nature of Hunger and Thirſt. 2. From the Saints, whom they are unmerciful to in their hunger and thirſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>From the Nature of Hunger and Thirſt.</hi> 1. Hunger and Thirſt both are intolerable evils, if come to the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of them, they are of a killing nature; <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was like to die with hunger, <hi>Jer.</hi> 38 9. and <hi>Samſon</hi> with thirſt, <hi>Judg.</hi> 15.18. and to be unmerciful to thoſe that are in this caſe, is murther in an high degree; and therefore may well be charged home upon ſuch at that day as are guilty of it. 2. Hunger and thirſt bring a long and lingring death along with them, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.9. and the longer and more lingring the death is, the more painful and ſore it is: it is to die many deaths; and therefore it is that Famine is not called <hi>an Arrow,</hi> as the Peſtilence is that kills quickly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.5. but it is called <hi>Arrows,</hi> and <hi>Evil Arrows,</hi> Ezek. 5.16. as if there were many deaths in it. Now to inflict many deaths upon the Members of Chriſt, and to let them die wounded
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95629:71"/>with ſo many arrows, that's great unmercifulneſs indeed; and therefore ſuch may well have that ſin charged home upon them at that day. 3. Hunger and thirſt in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of them, will make men and women unnatural to thoſe they love moſt, yea ſometimes to themſelves, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.53-57. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.28, 29. <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.10. <hi>Ezek</hi> 5.10. Now to refuſe to give meat to them that are hungry, and drink to the thirſty, is to put them upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural courſes, if God were not more merciful to them: and this ſin muſt needs be charged upon them at that day. 4. Hunger and thirſt make men look pale and ghaſtly, and ſo as to move men to pity. Now to be unmerciful to ſuch whoſe countenances beſpeak pity and compaſſion, that muſt needs be a ſin that Chriſt will charge home at that day. 5. Hunger and Thirſt exhauſt the very ſpirits, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.11, 12. Now to refuſe to give to thoſe meat and drink, who are almoſt expiring, and breathing out their laſt, is great cruelty. 6. Hunger and thirſt are warlike weapo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Saints themſelves.</hi> 1. They would bleſs them with their Prayers, if relieved, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. 2. They would procure the Lord to be their debtor, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.17. if ſuccoured. 3. They would bring a bleſſing upon their Poſterity and Families, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. 4. They would procure mercy for them at that day, <hi>ibid.</hi> 5. They would receive them into everlaſting habitations, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.9. 6. They would bring in more to them in outwards then they take from them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.24, 25. 7. They would feaſt them with Spiritual dainties: Now to be unmerciful to ſuch, in not giving them meat and drink, muſt needs be charged home upon them at that day.</p>

We ſee that unmercifulneſs, though it be not known to men, yet it is to the Lord, and he will one day reckon for it. 8. We ſee the truth of that in <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.17. <hi>The merciful man doth good to his own ſoul; but he that is cruel, troubleth his own fleſh.</hi> 9. We ſee how exceedingly the Lord abhors a covetous unmerciful ſpirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.3. 10.

We ſee how terrible he will be to thoſe that have been unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to their Souls, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 12.

                     <hi>From the nature of this ſin.</hi> 1. It is want of Humanity; ſuch men do un-Man themſelves, forget that they are men: now to be without Humanity, ſo far to degenerate as to loſs the nature of man, muſt needs be deeply charged upon men at that day. 2. It is want of natural affection, which is an Heatheniſh ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.31. and that is very unbeſeeming Chriſtianity. 3. It is a manifeſt breach of Rule, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.2. and how then ſhould it be otherwiſe, but that it ſhould be charged home upon thoſe that are guilty of it? 4. It is that that they would be unwilling ſhould be done to them: and to do that to others, that men would be loth ſhould be done to themſelves, is to deſpiſe the Law, and the Prophets, and the Law of Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.8. 5. It is great cruelty, and argues much hard-heartedneſs, <hi>Judg.</hi> 19.18, 19. and will not the Lord be ſevere to ſuch, and reckon ſore with cruel ones? 6. It comes croſs to the practiſe of holy men, <hi>Abraham, Lot,</hi> that good old man, <hi>Judg.</hi> 19.20, 21. <hi>Lydia, Act.</hi> 16.15. <hi>Job</hi> chap. 31, 32. and many others. 7. It is worſe then Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm, <hi>Act.</hi> 28.2, 7, 10. 8. It is that that is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking to the ſpirits of good men <hi>Luke</hi> 9.51, 52, 53, 54. and though they were too hot, which Chriſt rebukes them for, yet the ſin was great, and very provoking, although the ſweet diſpoſition of Chriſt would not then puniſh it. 9. It is a confluence of many ſins, and the very ſink that they come from, and run into, Pride, Covetouſneſs, Careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Senſleſneſs of others conditions, Barrenneſs, Unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs, Unbeleif, and theſe the Lord abhors. 10. It is the higheſt degree of ingratitude to Chriſt for his bounty in outward things beſtowed upon them.</p>

They are very precious in the ſight of the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.38. and not to entertain ſuch muſt needs be that that will be deeply charged upon men at that day. 2. They are in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of loſs of health, and life, in ſuch a condition, and therefore not to be received then, muſt needs provoke the Lord to lay his charge heavy upon ſuch as have been this way
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95629:73"/>guitty at that day. 3. They are ſuch as Chriſt has received to be of his houſhold, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.19. and made of the houſhold of Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. and not to receive ſuch to theſe mens houſes, muſt needs be very provoking. 4.

If neither of theſe ſhould come, yet it expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Saints to uncomelineſs; for to be naked, and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of clothing, is very uncomely: and the Lord would

It's true, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> miſſed the mark, when he charged <hi>Job</hi> with this; but yet it holds out, that he thought he was guilty, and chargeth it home upon him. Much more will Chriſt charge it deeply upon them that he knows to be guilty, at that day. 5. It is Inhumanity; and God would have us, as in other caſes, to ſhew our ſelves men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.8. 6. It is contrary to the Rule of the Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.11. 7. It comes croſs to the practice of the Saints, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.15. <hi>Job</hi> 31.19. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.39. 8.

We ſee that the Lords Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners are very dear to him, in that he will charge unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ones ſo deeply at that day, for not viſiting them in this their afflicted condition. 2. We ſee that he will ſurely charge it home upon them, that have without cauſe put them into Priſon, and have dealt cruelly with them there, by Pining, Starving, Torturing of them. 3. We ſee that ſurely the death of ſuch Priſoners is very precious in his ſight. If the death of every Saint be precious, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.15. then much more precious is the death of theſe Saints, that are Sufferers for him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6, 16. He will charge the wicked's not viſiting them, upon them; and therefore when they ſhed their Blood, it ſhall be coſtly to them: He will have a price for that Blood. 4. We ſee that the Saints way be content to be put in Priſon, and to ſuffer the Cruelty that ſometimes they there meet with; for Chriſt takes notice of it, and will deeply charge it upon unmerciful ones. 5. We ſee that the cloſeſt Priſons can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exclude Chriſt, nor ſhut out his love from his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38 39. 6. We ſee that if there be ſo much iniquity in a non viſit of Chriſts Priſoners, that it ſhall be ſo charged; Oh what is there in the Slaughter of ſo many as have been ſlain for Jeſus ſake in all Ages! 7. We ſee
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95629:77"/>that the worſt ſtate of the People of the Lord, even a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon-condition, is better then the beſt of hard hearted wicked, men, for theſe laſt muſt be accountable for their Neglects of poor Priſoners. 8. We ſee that omiſſions of ſmall kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to men in miſery, though we think not of them as any great matter, yet will be made ſo nothing of at that day. 9. We ſee how dear ſuch muſt pay for it, that have been and are of the Romiſh Religion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.24. 10. We ſee that Priſoners for Jeſus ſake, though not viſited by ſome men, yet have many a ſweet viſit from him, for he will make up their defect.</p>

In that they are one with Chriſt, both by a Conjugal Union, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. and by a Memberly Union, <hi>Epheſ</hi> 5.30. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.18. and by ſuch an Union as the Branches have with the Vine. <hi>John</hi> 15.4, 5. 2.

In that they are his Delight, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. and his Deſire, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.10. 7 In that they are his peculiar Treaſure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.4. and <hi>Titus</hi> 2.14. and <hi>Malac.</hi> 3.17. 8.

We ſee that we need never repeat of what we have done for Chriſt in his Saints; for
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95629:85"/>Eternal life will more then make amends for it, if we had done ten thouſand times more then we have done. 3. We ſee that when Chriſt once acquits us, and counts us Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, we need never doubt of partaking in life Eternal: if we make the former ſure, the latter will be ſure to us. 4. We ſee what a bleſſed thing it is to have the Sentence of Abſolution pronounced upon us, for ſuch as ſo have, ſhall go into life Eternal. 5. We ſee how deſireable the day of Judgement ſhould be to all the Saints, for after the ending of it, the Righteous ſhall go into life Eternal.

We ſee what thanks the Saints ſhould give to the Lord here, for the hope they have of this great Reward of Eternal life, and what thanks they will give hereafter to him, when they come to the poſſeſſion of it: They may well give thanks to him for ever for life Eternal; what ſhould they he thankful to him for, if not for this? 8.
